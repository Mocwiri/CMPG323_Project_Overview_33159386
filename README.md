# CMPG323_Project_Overview_33159386

The way the project is going to be structured is in a way to accomodate activities or tasks I should do or the unexpected events like the online of events this past week. Also classes and homeworks I should do, Then the training that I need for my portfolio of evidence which I must provide proof of before every project submission. Another thing I must think of is not only activities for this module but also take into account other work needed for other modules. How will I work around those extra tasks but also complete this one and others.

So for now I'm thinking of using only one repository for all the projects but have different branches each standing for it's own project, but that will be decided during the second project. Reason for wanting to use a single repository is so that I can edit any project expercially this project 1 easily to accomodate any changes needed on my schedule. If one repository doesn't seem to work fine I will create a repository for each project and I think that will be safer because once someone accessed one project that won't mean other are automatically breached. The main idea for using multiple repositories is for security reasons form my side.
